The more our society depends on digital systems, the more important private 
communication becomes.
We need private communications to sustain democracy, thus we need it to be 
available to everyone.
The purpose of this laboratory work is to introduce some practical aspects of 
private messaging.
More specifically, after it, you should be able to
\begin{itemize}
  \item \emph{apply} (securely!) some common implementations of cryptography 
    for private communication --- also including any set-up (e.g.\ key 
    verification).
  \item \emph{analyse} different systems for private communication based on 
    their security properties and \emph{evaluate} which is suitable in a given 
    situation.
  \item \emph{evaluate} different implementations of private communication from 
    a usability perspective.
\end{itemize}

The topics of this assignment are: usability~\cite[Ch.~2]{Anderson2008sea} and 
cryptography~\cite[Ch.~5]{Anderson2008sea} and 
\acp{PET}~\cite[Ch.~23.4]{Anderson2008sea}.
We then rely on the \enquote{Why Johnny can't encrypt} papers:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \citetitle{WhyJohnnyCantEncrypt}~\cite{WhyJohnnyCantEncrypt},
  \item \citetitle{WhyJohnnyStillCantEncrypt}~\cite{WhyJohnnyStillCantEncrypt},
  \item \citetitle{WhyJohnnyStillStillCantEncrypt}~\cite{WhyJohnnyStillStillCantEncrypt},
  \item \citetitle{CanJohnnyFinallyEncrypt}~\cite{CanJohnnyFinallyEncrypt}.
\end{itemize}
