Implement the following algorithm.

Input: The text in this document.
Output: The filename of the next step.

Let X = [0] be a list containing one element, the integer zero.

For each line L:
    Let Y = 0.
    For each character C in L:
        Let Y = Y XOR ASCII(C), where ASCII(C) is the ASCII 
        representation of the character C.
    XOR Y and the last element in X.
    Append Y to X.

Return the concatenation of the hexadecimal representation of the 
elements in X.
