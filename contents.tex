\section{Introduction}%
\label{Introduction}

In this lab we will evaluate some tools for private communication, in 
particular, email and instant messaging.

Email security has the longest history, this has been around since the 80s.
Have they gained wide-spread adoption yet?
No.
There are two competing approaches: Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) and S/MIME.
But there are alternatives coming, \eg ProtonMail made the headlines a few 
years ago.

The security of instant messaging looks better than that of email.
This is largely due to the extensive use of smartphones for messaging.
There are apps such as Signal, WhatsApp (uses Signal's protocol) and a few 
more.
Have they gained wide-spread adoption yet?
More than for email.


\section{Assignment}%
\label{sec:Tasks}

The assignment is divided into two parts, the first focuses on email and the 
second on instant messaging.

\subsection{Email security}

List the security (and privacy) expectations that you have on email.
Try to install and use a tool (\eg GPG, ProtonMail, \etc) that achieves those 
expectations, or comes as close as possible, for securing an email conversation 
with a friend.

\subsection{Instant-messaging security}

List the security (and privacy) expectations that you have on instant messages.
(Are they different than for email?)
Try to install and use a tool (\eg Signal, WhatsApp, \etc) that achieves those 
expectations, or comes as close as possible, for securing a conversation with a 
friend.

\subsection{Reflection}

What were the biggest problems that you encountered?
What must be done to resolve them?
Can they be resolved?

Read the \enquote{Why Johnny can't encrypt} papers which has studied exactly 
this problem throughout the years:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \citetitle{WhyJohnnyCantEncrypt}~\cite{WhyJohnnyCantEncrypt},
  \item \citetitle{WhyJohnnyStillCantEncrypt}~\cite{WhyJohnnyStillCantEncrypt},
  \item \citetitle{WhyJohnnyStillStillCantEncrypt}~\cite{WhyJohnnyStillStillCantEncrypt},
\end{itemize}
all concern email, whereas 
\citetitle{CanJohnnyFinallyEncrypt}~\cite{CanJohnnyFinallyEncrypt} concerns 
instant messaging.

What problems did they find?
What methods did they use?


\section{Examination}

Note down your thoughts from reading, experimenting and the reflections for the 
questions above and bring to the seminar session.
